title: Building the Left
subtitle: Push the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> to the left.

We have increased the strength of the left faction with the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>. This raised concern among the moderate reformists in the party.

@kpd_cooperation

title: Cooperation with the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>
subtitle: Any cooperation between the parties requires compromise from the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> as well as the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>.

Levi attempts to reach out to his former colleagues to dissuade the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> from their current extreme <span style="color: #8B0000;">Stalinist</span> path. Some concessions are extracted.
